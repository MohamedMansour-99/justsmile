                Software is more than just a program code.A program is an executable code,
                 which serves some computational purpose. Software is considered
                 to be collection of executable programming code, associated libraries 
                 and documentations.  Software, when made for a specific requirement
                  is called software product.
                 Engineering on the other hand, is all about developing products,
                 using well-defined,scientific principles and methods.Software engineering is
                  an engineering branch associated with development of software product
                   using well-defined scientific principles, methods and procedures.
                 The outcome of software engineering is an efficient and reliable software product.
                 Software Evolution The process of developing a software product using 
                 software engineering principles and methods is referred to as software evolution.
                  This includes the initial development of software and its maintenance and updates, 
                  till desired software product is developed, which satisfies the expected requirements.
                  Evolution starts from the requirement gathering process. After which developers 
                  create a prototype of the intended software and show it to the users to get their
                   feedback at the early stage of software product development. The users suggest changes,
                 on which several consecutive updates and maintenance keep on changing too.
                 This process changes to the original software, till the desired software is accomplished
